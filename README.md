# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using a combination of Python, SQL, and Power BI to extract actionable insights that can guide businesses in making informed decisions.

Data Analytics Project: Customer Behavior Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to derive actionable insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions. The project involves loading, cleaning, and exploring a dataset using Python, executing SQL queries on relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server), and presenting the results through a Power BI dashboard and a comprehensive report. The final deliverables include a PowerPoint presentation generated using Gamma.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer demographics, transaction history, browsing behavior, and purchase patterns. It provides valuable data for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), segmentation, and predicting customer behavior.
The data includes the following features:
1. Customer ID
2. Age, Gender, and Location
3. Purchase History
4. Frequency of Purchases
5. Browsing Data
6.Other Behavioral Metrics
The dataset is preloaded into a relational database, and SQL queries are used to extract and manipulate the data.

Tools

This project utilizes a combination of the following tools and technologies:
 >Python: For data manipulation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
 >Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 >SQL: For querying and analyzing data from PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server databases.
 >Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key insights from the data.
 >Gamma: For creating professional PowerPoint presentations to summarize findings.

Steps
1. Loading the Dataset:
   >The dataset is loaded into a PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server database for efficient querying.
   >Python is used to load the data from the database and perform initial checks.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   >Use Python's data manipulation libraries (Pandas & NumPy) to clean the data and check for       missing or inconsistent values.
   >Perform EDA using visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to               understand data distributions and relationships.

3. Data Cleaning:
   >Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate entries.
   >Normalize the data and convert categorical features into numeric representations (using          techniques like One-Hot Encoding).

4. SQL Queries:
   >Run SQL queries to filter, join, and aggregate the data.
   >Extract the necessary data for analysis, including customer segments and behavioral trends.

5. Power BI Dashboard:
   >Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
   >Design and build a dashboard with key metrics such as:
      =>Customer Segments
      =>Sales Trends
      =>Purchase Frequency
      =>Churn Prediction
   
6. Create a Report:
   >Document the findings from the analysis and visualize the key metrics.
   >Create a detailed report summarizing the insights and recommendations for the business.
   
7. Create PowerPoint Presentation:
   >Use Gamma to create a professional PowerPoint presentation, summarizing the findings and        visualizations from Power BI and the report.

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard created in this project allows stakeholders to interact with the data and view real-time insights, including:
  >Customer Segmentation: Visualize how customers are grouped based on purchasing behavior.
  >Sales Performance: Track sales trends and performance over time.
  >Churn Prediction: Predict customer churn and identify high-risk customers.
  >Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Calculate and visualize the value each customer brings to the    business.

Results
>Customer Insights: The analysis reveals key customer segments, purchase patterns, and           behavioral trends.
>Segmentation: Different customer groups are identified, allowing businesses to tailor           marketing efforts.
>Predictive Model: A model for predicting customer churn is developed, allowing the company to   take proactive actions to retain customers.
>Business Recommendations: Insights from the analysis guide strategies for customer retention,   targeted marketing, and sales optimization.
